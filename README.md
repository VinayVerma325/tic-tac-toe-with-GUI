🎮 Tic Tac Toe with GUI (C++ & SFML).

A 2D Tic Tac Toe game built using C++ and SFML. This project demonstrates event-driven programming, game loop design, mouse input handling, and basic AI logic.

🚀 Features

Interactive 3×3 GUI board.  
Human vs Computer gameplay.  
Random AI opponent.  
Win / Draw detection.  
Event-driven architecture.  
Clean grid rendering using SFML.

🛠 Tech Stack

C++ 
SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)  
Microsoft Visual Studio 2022  
Git & GitHub

🎯 How It Works

Player places X using mouse clicks   
Computer automatically places O   
Game checks:  
Horizontal win   
Vertical win   
Diagonal win   
Draw condition   
Game stops when a result is detected
